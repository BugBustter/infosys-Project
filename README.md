## 🚀 Executive Summary

**BudgetWise AI** is a robust, full-stack financial management platform designed to democratize financial literacy through intelligent automation. Unlike traditional spreadsheets, BudgetWise leverages the power of **Generative AI (Google Gemini)** to analyze spending habits and provide actionable financial advice.

Built with a modern **React.js** frontend and a secure **Spring Boot** backend, the application ensures data integrity via **MySQL** while offering a seamless user experience with **Clerk Authentication**. It bridges the gap between raw financial data and meaningful insights, helping users track income, manage budgets, and visualize their financial health in real-time.

* **Smart Insights:** Automatically detects high-spending categories and suggests budget adjustments.

### 3. **Dynamic Visualization**
